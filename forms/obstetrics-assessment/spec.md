# Obstetrics Assessment — specification

This file is the **living domain spec** for this form. It captures the contract each implementation (SQL schema, generated representations, front-ends, and Rust backend) must satisfy. Treat it as the source of truth for behaviour — update the spec before changing code.

Slug: `obstetrics-assessment`

## 1. Purpose

Antenatal obstetric assessment aligned with NICE NG201, stratifying pregnancies into low, moderate, and high risk to allocate care pathway (midwifery-led, obstetrician-led, or multidisciplinary) and to schedule surveillance, screening, and birth planning.

Full design description: [`index.md`](index.md).

## 2. Scope

In scope: the schema, scoring engine, four front-ends (form + dashboard, each in HTML and SvelteKit), and the Rust full-stack crate listed in §5. Out of scope: hosted deployment, authentication, multi-tenancy.

## 3. Scoring system

- **Instrument**: NICE NG201 Antenatal Risk Assessment
- **Range**: Low Risk / Moderate Risk / High Risk
- **Categories**:
  - Low Risk: No obstetric, medical, or social risk factors — midwifery-led care
  - Moderate Risk: Modifiable risk factors requiring obstetric input at key milestones
  - High Risk: Significant pre-existing or pregnancy-related pathology — consultant-led / multidisciplinary care

## 4. Inputs and outputs

**Inputs.** A typed assessment object whose shape mirrors the SQL schema in `sql-migrations/` (8 migration files). Unanswered text and enum fields default to `''`; unanswered numeric, date, and time fields default to `null`.

**Outputs.** A grading object emitted by the engine: scoring result (per the instrument named in §3), `firedRules[]`, `additionalFlags[]`, and a clinical / administrative report. Rendered as HTML in the browser, exported as PDF via the SvelteKit endpoint, and convertible to FHIR R5 Bundle, XML, JSON, CSV, or TSV.

## 5. Artefacts

Required artefacts and their current status:

| Subdirectory | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `sql-migrations` | source of truth |
| `xml-representations` | generated |
| `fhir-r5` | generated |
| `protobuf` | generated |
| `openapi` | generated |
| `front-end-form-with-html` | Lily contract |
| `front-end-form-with-svelte` | SvelteKit |
| `front-end-dashboard-with-html` | Lily contract |
| `front-end-dashboard-with-svelte` | SvelteKit + SVAR |
| `back-end-with-loco` | Rust + Loco JSON API |
| `back-end-with-loco-setup` | generated scaffold script |

Generated artefacts (XML, FHIR R5, Protocol Buffers, OpenAPI, Loco setup script) are never hand-edited; re-run the generators in [`/AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §Tools after schema changes.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- `bin/test-form obstetrics-assessment` exits cleanly.
- The scoring engine is pure (no side effects, no I/O) and unit-tested.
- The HTML front-ends conform to the Lily HTML headless contract
  ([`forms/AGENTS-front-end-html.md`](../AGENTS-front-end-html.md)).
- The SvelteKit front-ends conform to the Lily Svelte headless contract
  ([`forms/AGENTS-front-end-svelte.md`](../AGENTS-front-end-svelte.md))
  and pass `pnpm check` and `pnpm test`.
- The Rust crate builds (`cargo build`) and tests pass (`cargo test`).
- `bin/lily-html-refactor --check obstetrics-assessment` reports no drift.
- LocalStorage keys preserve draft state across reloads:
  - `obstetrics-assessment.front-end-form-with-html.v1` (HTML)
  - `obstetrics-assessment.front-end-form-with-svelte.v1` (SvelteKit)

## 7. Compliance

Inherits the monorepo compliance baseline: MDCG 2019-11 Rev.1 (EU MDR), UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002, ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514:2022, UK MHRA Software and AI as a Medical Device. Form-specific classification (e.g. Class IIa where output drives clinical decisions) is recorded in [`index.md`](index.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) where it differs from the baseline.

# Code of Conduct Notice

Read-and-acknowledge code of conduct notice presenting the twelve core principles that medical-service providers and supporting staff must uphold, with signature capture to record acknowledgement.

This skill is the end-user-facing guide to this specific form; for cross-form concepts and terminology shared across the monorepo, use `form-examples-skill`. For implementation work on this form's code, use `code-of-conduct-notice-maintainer-skill` instead.

## Scoring system

- **Instrument**: Completeness Validation
- **Range**: Complete / Incomplete
- **Categories**:
  - Complete: All acknowledgement fields filled
  - Incomplete: One or more missing
- **Engine files**: `types.ts`, `form-validator.ts`, `validation-rules.ts`, `flagged-issues.ts`, `utils.ts`
- **Test file**: `form-validator.test.ts`

## Worked examples

- [`../../examples/personas.json`](../../examples/personas.json) — hand-authored realistic scenarios with the engine's exact expected output for each one.
- [`../../examples/assessment.json`](../../examples/assessment.json) — a type-defaulted example of the form's data shape (blank/typed, not a realistic scenario).

description: "Implementation workflow for maintaining and extending the Medical Records Release Permission form (forms/medical-records-release-permission/) — editing its spec, schema, or engine, regenerating derived artefacts, and running its verify gates. Use when implementing a change to this form's spec, SQL schema, front-end, back-end, or personas. For the repo-wide workflow, use form-examples-maintainer-skill instead."

# Medical Records Release Permission — Maintainer Skill

Implementation-facing companion to `medical-records-release-permission-skill` (this form's end-user concepts skill) and to `form-examples-maintainer-skill` (the repo-wide maintainer skill — read that one first for the golden rule, generators, and the full verify-gate catalogue). This skill is the one-form-scoped map.

## Directory layout

`forms/medical-records-release-permission/` contains:

| Subdirectory | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `sql` | source of truth |
| `xml` | generated |
| `fhir` | generated |
| `protobuf` | generated |
| `openapi` | generated |
| `front-end-with-html` | HTML + Lily (wizard + dashboard) |
| `front-end-with-svelte` | SvelteKit (wizard + dashboard) |
| `back-end-with-loco` | Rust + Loco JSON API |

Generated artefacts (`xml`, `fhir`, `protobuf`, `openapi`, the Loco setup script, `CHANGELOG.md`, `examples/assessment.json`) are never hand-edited — regenerate them instead; see the tool catalogue in [`/AGENTS.md`](../../../../AGENTS.md).

## Scoring system

- **Instrument**: Form Completeness Validation
- **Range**: Complete/Incomplete
- **Categories**: Complete (all required fields provided and consent given), Incomplete (missing required information or consent)
- **Engine files**: `types.ts`, `form-validator.ts`, `validation-rules.ts`, `flagged-issues.ts`, `utils.ts`
- **Test file**: `form-validator.test.ts`
